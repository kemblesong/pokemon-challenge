| 4 | Good explanations; asks relevant questions |
| 3 | Adequate communication; some prompting needed |
| 2 | Minimal explanation; difficulty articulating decisions |
| 1 | Unable or unwilling to communicate approach |

### TypeScript (15%)

- Proper typing of components and functions
- Effective use of provided interfaces
- Avoiding `any` unless justified
- Understanding of generics where appropriate

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Strong typing throughout; leverages TypeScript features well |
| 4 | Good type coverage; minimal `any` usage |
| 3 | Basic typing; some loose types |
| 2 | Frequent `any` usage; type errors ignored |
| 1 | Effectively untyped; TypeScript errors throughout |

### Code Quality (15%)

**What we're looking for:**
- Clear, readable code
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Appropriate separation of concerns
- Consistent style

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Exceptionally clean code; production-ready quality |
| 4 | Good readability; clear naming; well-organized |
| 3 | Adequate quality; some areas could be cleaner |
| 2 | Difficult to follow; poor naming; inconsistent |
| 1 | Unreadable; no organization |

## What We Value

### Green Flags
- Thinks out loud and explains decisions
- Asks clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Handles errors and edge cases gracefully
- Creates appropriate abstractions (not too many, not too few)
- Prioritizes effectively and ships working features
- Shows awareness of performance considerations
- Writes code that's easy to understand and modify

### Red Flags
- Silent coding without explanation
- Over-engineering simple solutions
- Ignoring TypeScript errors
- No error handling whatsoever
- Poor time management (spending too long on one thing)
- Copy-pasting code without understanding it
- Not asking questions when stuck

## Final Notes

- **Completion isn't everything** - We'd rather see well-structured partial work than rushed, messy complete work
- **It's okay to look things up** - We all use documentation; just explain what you're looking for
- **Ask for help if stuck** - We're here to see you succeed, not to watch you struggle silently
- **Have fun!** - This is a Pokemon app after all
